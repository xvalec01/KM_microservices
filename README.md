# KM_microservices
## Explanation
**This is still in development**

This project contains 3 modules (microservices) and should be devided into 3 different repositories in GitHub. To simplify it into one repository I chose building 3 different images with docker-compose.

GitHub is now used only as a open storage for my code, commits are not made to be clean, explanatory, small and with some rules as it is common habbit so does the branching is not following common rules.
